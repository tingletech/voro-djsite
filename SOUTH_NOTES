Bit of work to use south with many-to-many fields

I was trying to change a many-to-many to use a through field for ordering and had to do the following:

edit the models.py and add a manytomany field with the new through class, you will have to add 'related_name' args to the field. Make it <parentobject>_set for the new field and '+' for the old (to ignore the reverse).

Then run an auto schema migration
Migrate

Then run an datamigration. In the migration copy data from the old plain vanilla manytomany field into the new through objects one. (see themed_collection/migraions/0003_mosaic_member_data.py for example)
Migrate

Then remove the old manytomany field from the parent model and run another auto schema migration
Migrate

change any references to the old field name to the new field name.

Then you will have to make the new field work through inlines?
Need to add an explicit AdminModel, with Inline & xxx.xxx.through as the model
