      "markup": "<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Exploring\r\nthe Images</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These images of civic architecture are from cities throughout California. They\r\ninclude missions, courthouses, city halls, and the state capitol building \u2014 important sites for city development and\r\nmanagement. These buildings connect towns and cities to the state, and provide\r\nplaces for community members to seek legal redress, submit building plans,\r\napply for permits, and engage in local government. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Civic architecture \u2014 from\r\nmissions to skyscrapers \u2014 embodies\r\nthe way a community wants others to see it. These buildings were designed to\r\nbroadcast their institutional importance to the city. They were built to\r\nendure, providing a legacy to the area\u2019s growth and development.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Missions</h2>The Spanish mission system provided the institutional framework for Spanish colonization and California\u2019s\r\nearly settlement. Missions like <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf8n39p4t7/\">this one in Monterey</a> became focal\r\npoints of the area\u2019s development, central to community identity and activity.<br><br>Many missions have fallen into\r\ndisrepair, but several \u2014\r\nincluding <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt0m3nb50g/\">Mission San Juan Capistrano</a> \u2014 remain as living symbols that provide\r\nphysical ties to a community\u2019s history. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Making\r\nCalifornia Modern</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to become a state,\r\nCalifornia had to show that it had the capability of legally upholding the\r\nnation\u2019s laws, moving away from its earlier reputation for \u201cmurder and mayhem.\u201d Building\r\nand maintaining institutions showed eastern lawmakers that California was ready to be part of a\r\nmodern, civilized nation.</p>So, in the mid-1800s, counties throughout the state wanted to symbolize law and order. They built <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft496n99q4/\">impressive courthouses in places as far north as Eureka</a>.<br><br>The <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt3g50175f/\">Mono\r\nCounty courthouse</a>\r\nwas constructed in 1880 in Bridgeport with the immense wealth generated\r\nfrom the gold finds in Bodie. It is still in use today.<br><br>Courthouses were also\r\nvital sites of community membership. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt0t1nc3v6/\">This 1915 image</a> shows Japanese citizens of Hanford dedicating a fountain in front of the Kings County courthouse.<br><br>City halls, like\r\n<a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt8779r1sw/\">this one in Marysville</a>, housed\r\nmany of the institutions necessary to run city government and were generally\r\nlarge, impressive structures. Like <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt167nb615/\">Santa Ana\u2019s city\r\nhall,\r\nshown here</a> with an early group of\r\ntourists, they were important civic gathering places for city clubs and groups. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt4m3nc4p1/\">San Diego's City Hall</a> displayed its patriotism with American flags and bunting.<br><br>Most notable is the construction\r\nof the <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt2t1nf2dh/\">State Capitol building in Sacramento</a>. Using classical\r\narchitectural components and modeled after the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., the impressive\r\ndome is still a reminder of the importance of government to the state. The\r\nbuilding took nearly 15 years to complete, as you can see from <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt8489q25z/\">this image of an\r\nearly phase of its\r\nconstruction</a>. It still houses California\u2019s state government\r\nand serves as the central battleground of the state\u2019s politics. <h2>Looking\r\nto the Future</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The early 20<sup>th</sup> century was an\r\nera of great change, new technologies, and increased professionalization. Larger and more vertical structures were built to house the growing\r\nnumber of institutions needed to successfully run California\u2019s growing\r\ncities. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf467nb5p3/\">Oakland\u2019s new\r\ncity hall</a> was\r\ncompleted in 1914, after the previous building was destroyed in the 1906\r\nearthquake. At nearly 320 feet, it was the first high-rise government building\r\nin the United States. It was also the tallest building west of the Mississippi\r\nwhen it was completed. In the wake of disaster, much of the Bay Area rebuilt itself using\r\nmodern architecture, staking California\u2019s claim as a center of 20<sup>th</sup>\r\ncentury innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt196nb7z8/\">1928 Los Angeles City Hall</a> is\r\nanother example of modern architecture. With 32 floors, and at 454 feet high,\r\nit was huge for its time, and is still in use today. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The longevity of these institutions can be attributed to their modern\r\nconstruction and design, and their importance to a community\u2019s image. Los\r\nAngeles City Hall is consciously symbolic; among other features, its concrete\r\nwas composed of sand from all of California\u2019s 58 counties and water from 21\r\nmissions. The building is an iconic emblem of city government, and its image\r\nhas been on city police badges since 1940. And as recently as 1964, it was\r\nstill the city\u2019s tallest building. </p>",

      "markup": "<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Exploring\r\nthe Images</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The images in this set give us a view of what life in\r\nCalifornia was like at street level in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and\r\nearly to mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. The growth\r\nof cities and\r\narrival of new immigrants following the Gold Rush\r\nadded to California\u2019s ethnic diversity. In less\r\nthan 100 years, California\u2019s population exploded: from just under 100,000\r\npeople in the first 1850 census to over 5.5 million people by 1930.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Geography and Industry</h2>Many of these city scenes reflect the\r\nenvironment. Others show the impact of major industries connected to the area\u2019s\r\ngeography. The present-day ghost town of Bodie in Mono County was constructed high in the mountains,\r\nalongside <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt567nc42d/\">gold mining operations</a>, so\r\nmost building and living supplies had to be transported to the area.<br><br>The early gold\r\ncountry town of Grass Valley had <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt2p3015d3/\">elevated covered sidewalks and balconies</a> to protect\r\npeople from muddy, unpaved streets and the mess of horse-driven transportation.<br><br>Early images of Signal Hill in Long Beach feature\r\nthe <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt096nd5tt/\">oil derricks</a> that\r\nwere so closely linked to the area\u2019s development. And Westwood, in Lassen County, grew\r\nup around the <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf78700763/\">lumber industry</a>, where\r\nmills were a common sight. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt8d5nc24q/\">Orange groves</a> frame several early agricultural boomtowns,\r\nlending the inspiration for place names like the city of Orange in Orange County. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Culture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The culture of cities is also reflected in their buildings.\r\nFarming cities like Fresno displayed their growth and agricultural wealth with <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt8w1021t0/\">multistoried buildings</a> in the central downtown areas. Sacramento, the state capitol, copied the nation\u2019s capitol, Washington, D.C.,\r\nwith a grid of streets radiating from the centrally located <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt787019hh/\">Capitol Building</a>. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Influence also came from\r\nneighboring Mexico. As early as 1904, mounted patrols began guarding\r\nCalifornia\u2019s southern border. When the border patrol became official in 1924,\r\ntowns soon developed along the U.S.-Mexico border. Calexico was established to serve as a border checkpoint, and housed a <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt1489p9q0/\">U.S. Customs Office</a>. </p>Some cities still maintained elements of Spanish and Californio society in their\r\nadobe buildings. This can be seen in the <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf5290088p/\">first\r\nfederal court building in Monterey</a>, and the beautiful Spanish <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt287016t5/\">patio of the Mission\r\nInn in Riverside</a>. San Diego kept some of the Spanish\r\nColonial architectural style but demolished and rebuilt larger, more modern\r\nbuildings like the <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6h4nc5x3/\">Santa Fe Train Depot</a>. \r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Social\r\nGathering Places</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Stores, saloons, drugstores, theaters, hotels, and churches\r\nbecame central meeting places for people in towns and cities. By the 1890s, residents\r\nof the San Bernardino area might\r\nhave purchased food staples from <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt6h4nc7md/\">Casner and Burns\r\nGrocery Store</a>. Spots like\r\n<a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft6b69n7r0/\">Pinks Saloon</a> along\r\nthe north coast provided places\r\nfor people to gather, relax, and enjoy food and drink. Early drugstores, like <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt9r29q5fs/\">Clements in El Centro</a>, also served as the local\r\nice cream parlor, lunch counter, and film processor. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theaters, like <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt229024cm/\">this\r\none in Marysville</a>, became sites\r\nfor popular culture. People\r\nwho lived far from cities could still enjoy live performances and vaudeville\r\nacts. Some were later converted to movie theaters. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hotels, like the <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt4z09q9j1/\">Acheson Hotel in Berkeley</a>, were meeting places for\r\ntravelers and residents alike. Churches also served as community hubs. Some,\r\nlike <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt9v19r7tj/\">St. Vincent Cathedral in Los Angeles</a>, provided a\r\ngeographical and social landmark in a rapidly expanding city.&nbsp; </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Streets, too, developed around\r\nsocial needs, many times based on the local industry or environment. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt1489p8r1/\">Portsmouth Square in San Francisco</a> organized neighborhood\r\ndevelopment around a central plaza. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt2q2nd85p/\">Third Street in Santa Monica</a> was envisioned from\r\nthe start as a comfortable shopping district. And the <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt5z09q1tm/\">storefronts on Palm Drive</a> near Desert Hot Springs, with their palm-lined\r\nwalkways, consciously incorporated elements of the desert lifestyle.</p>Many of the cities pictured here have changed dramatically\r\nover the last 100 years. With the growth of the suburbs after\r\nWorld War II, for example, tracts of agricultural land became housing\r\ndevelopments or shopping malls. Yet some old buildings and streets remain, providing\r\nvital links to a city\u2019s history and origins.",

      "markup": "<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Exploring the Images</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before\r\nEuropean and American development, Native\r\nCalifornian groups altered the landscape purposefully to preserve it, and avoided areas\r\nthey knew to be dangerous. But by the mid-1800s, the Gold Rush brought a population boom.</p><p>These\r\nnewcomers naturally built new towns and cities around bays, harbors, rivers,\r\nmountains, and fertile valleys. But because they didn\u2019t know the landscape\u2019s\r\nhistory, some communities were built on top of potentially dangerous\r\nenvironmental factors, such as flood plains and unseen earthquake faults.</p><p>From the mid-19<sup>th</sup> to\r\nearly 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, earthquakes, floods, fire, disease, and other\r\ncatastrophes shaped and re-shaped California\u2019s natural environment and the new\r\ntowns and cities growing up across the state. These images document both\r\nnatural and human-caused disasters across California during the era, especially\r\nthe destruction to property and peoples\u2019 lives following fires, floods, and\r\nearthquakes. </p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: yui-tmp;\"></p><h2>Flood and Drought</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fresh\r\nwater \u2014 in\r\ngroundwater, rivers, and lakes \u2014 is one of California\u2019s most prized natural resources. But controlling\r\nand managing water for drinking and irrigation has not been easy.</p><p>Images\r\nof <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb4m3nb05j/\">Oroville</a> and <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf9d5nb5bs/\">Alturas</a> in the Shasta Cascade region show the devastating\r\neffects of heavy rain and extensive flooding in the town areas. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt2489q6sb/\">Flood\r\nimages from Marysville</a>, in the Gold Country, show the streets filled with flood water.</p><p>Cities\r\nlike Anaheim in Southern\r\nCalifornia <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt8199q44r/\">experienced major flooding</a> and immense population growth. A building boom resulted in\r\nthe cementing over of natural watersheds, which increased the potential\r\nfor flooding.</p><p>Large-scale\r\nirrigation projects intended to help farmers and prevent cycles of drought and\r\nsevere flooding continue to affect large portions of California. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt0t1nc3tp/\">Canals built along the Kern River</a> near Bakersfield were\r\ncrucial to harnessing California\u2019s agricultural potential. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt138nc4jr/\">Enormous labor demands</a> were required to create and maintain the <span>Central Valley\u2019s irrigation\r\nprojects</span>.</p><p>The\r\ncity of Los Angeles, now with a population of over 9 million people, was built\r\nin an arid desert. This meant diverting billions of gallons of water for\r\ndrinking and agriculture from other sources around the state and building\r\nnumerous dams and power plants.</p><h2>Earthquakes </h2>California\u2019s\r\nthousands of fault lines make cities throughout the state vulnerable. Because\r\nearthquakes reverberate far beyond the epicenter, widespread damage can result.<br><br>The 1906\r\nSan Francisco earthquake was felt throughout the greater Bay Area. The <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb3j49p0kg/\">Old Russian Church at Fort Ross</a>, some 90 miles north of San\r\nFrancisco, was damaged. <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb5m3nb49v/\">Parts of Santa Rosa</a>, some 55 miles northeast of the\r\ncity, were in ruins.<br><br>The devastation in San Francisco itself was significant.\r\nThe city appears nearly flattened in <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb3779p0cd/\">this bird\u2019s-eye\r\nview</a>. The once\r\nimpressive pillars of <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb6c6008nn/\">City Hall crumbled to the streets</a>,\r\nblocking roadways and creating safety hazards.<br><h2>Fire</h2> Fires,\r\nlike the one that left the Central Valley\u2019s <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/kt0489q061/\">Kutner-Goldstein department store in ruins</a> in 1928, can\r\nchange the landscape. The <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb8h4nb6dn/\">devastating fires</a> that followed the 1906 quake in San Francisco restructured the city. \r\n\r\nThe\r\nfire killed 3,000 people, destroyed much of the city, and <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb987010bv/\">left 225,000 people homeless</a>.\r\nAlthough many stayed to rebuild, some \u2014 including Chinatown residents\r\nand many African Americans \u2014 relocated to Oakland, reshaping that city\u2019s demographics. Others fled\r\nto Los Angeles in search of food, clean water, and the supplies needed to rebuild\r\ntheir lives.<br><h2>Disease</h2><p>Uncontrolled waste and\r\nvermin in dumps, in the streets, and in cramped living spaces contributed to disasters in densely populated towns and cities. In Los Angeles\r\nin 1924, pneumonic plague <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf1t1nb5bx/\">carried by rats</a> spread quickly.</p><span>The\r\ncity established <a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf1q2nb51m/\">disinfecting crews</a> to eradicate any potential infected rat and squirrel populations, and\r\ndestroyed rundown buildings considered potentials for disease. </span><a href=\"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf8p3011vd/\">Suspect buildings</a> and people were quarantined for weeks.<p>Some\r\nquarantined neighborhoods were home to Mexican immigrants. This led to reframing dialogue about the\r\ndisease in racial terms. The movement toward containing disease became\r\nabout quarantining certain neighborhoods perceived as a \u201cpublic menace.\u201d <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"></span></p><h2>How disasters reshaped cities</h2><p>Surprisingly,\r\nmost disaster survivors \u2014 whether displaced by flood, fire, or earthquake \u2014 did not leave or move to\r\nsafer ground. Instead, people worked to rebuild and reshape their cities in the same place. They used newer and better\r\nbuilding materials and techniques, hoping to create sturdier structures that\r\nwould withstand another natural disaster. \r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n</p><p>For\r\nexample, In San Francisco, the earthquake brought down brick buildings and the\r\nfire burned the wooden ones. The city was rebuilt with more expensive but\r\ntheoretically safer reinforced concrete, which\r\nallowed for taller, more modern, and more stable structures, changing the city\u2019s\r\nskyline. Although natural disasters continue to threaten California\u2019s cities\r\nand towns, its people continue to find new ways to reinvent and work with their\r\nexisting environment. </p>",
